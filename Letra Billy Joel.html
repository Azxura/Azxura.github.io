<h4>
You have to learn to pace yourself<br>
(Pressure)<br>
You're just like everybody else<br>
(Pressure)<br>
You've only had to run so far, so good<br>
But you will come to a place<br>
Where the only thing you feel<br>
Are loaded guns in your face<br>
And you'll have to deal with pressure<br>
</h4>
<h4>
You used to call me paranoid<br>
(Pressure)<br>
But even you cannot avoid<br>
(Pressure)<br>
You turn the tap-dance into your crusade<br>
Now here you are with your faith<br>
And your Peter Pan advice<br>
You have no scars on your face<br>
And you cannot handle pressure<br>
</h4>
<h4>
All grown up and no place to go<br>
Psych one, psych two<br>
What do you know?<br>
All your life is Channel 13<br>
Sesame Street<br>
What does it mean?<br>
</h4>
<h4>
I'll tell you what it means<br>
Pressure, presure<br>
</h4>
<h4>
Don't ask for help, you're all alone<br>
(Pressure)<br>
You'll have to answer to your own<br>
(Pressure)<br>
I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale<br>
Well, here you are, in the ninth<br>
Two men out and three men on<br>
Nowhere to look, but inside<br>
Where we all respond to pressure<br>
Pressure<br>
</h4>
<h4>
All your life is Time Magazine<br>
I read it too<br>
What does it mean?<br>
</h4>
<h4>
Pressure!<br>
</h4>
<h4>
I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale<br>
But here you are with your faith<br>
And your Peter Pan advice<br>
You have no scars on your face<br>
And you cannot handle pressure<br><br>
The pressure<br>
</h4>
<h4>
Pressure<br>
One, two, three, four, pressure!<br>
</h4>
